# Docker Dev Env

A simple but yet large docker image containing a complete(maybe?) development
env

## Build and run
First, you never guessed it, but this makes use of Docker! Make sure to
download it off their website.

```bash
# To build the image
docker build -t dev-env .

# To run the image!
docker run -it --rm dev-env
```
